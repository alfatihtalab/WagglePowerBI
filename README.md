# **Building a Power BI Report for Waggle**

Project 2 of Udacity's [Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analysis-and-visualization-with-power-BI-nanodegree--nd331)
in **Creating Visualizations with Power BI** course.

## Project Description:
Waggle is a startup that makes smart devices for pets. Recently, they has been thrilled by the success of their new Lapdog device, a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas! Reviews have been fantastic, sales are growing, and—best of all—the product really works! 

The product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, we have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices to either help convince the CEO that Lapcat is the next big thing or a costly mistake to be avoided.

Below is a quick demonestration about the project components.


### Report Requirements:
- The CEO is curious about the following questions:
  - Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
  - Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?
- The Chief Marketing Officer would like the report to be “on-brand” by including only colors from the Waggle color palette, the Waggle logo, and other approved company logos and icons.

The report is to include 3 tabs
- The first page should highlight the CEO’s business questions, specifically calling out the differences in average step count and average user rating between Lapdog and Lapcat devices.
- The second page should focus on insights related to pets using the device.
- The third page should focus on insights related to the families that own the pets.
